* A string is a sequence of zero or more characters. Each character has an index that refers to the character's position. Indexes are numbered from left to right, starting at 0. Indexes are also numbered from right to left, starting at -1.

* An object's identity is a unique integer associated with the object. Generally, this integer refers to the memory location where the object is stored. Once created, an object's identity never changes. The built-in type() function returns the object's type.
* An object's type determines the possible values and operations of an object. Ex: Integers and floats can be "divided" using the / operator, but strings cannot. The built-in type() function returns the object's type.
* An object's value represents the current state of the object. Many objects, such as numbers and strings, cannot be modified once created. Some objects, such as lists (introduced later), are designed to be modified.
* A memory diagram shows the relationship between variables and objects.
